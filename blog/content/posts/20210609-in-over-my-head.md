## Adventures in the Cloud - in over my head

So today I've installed Git Hub locally on my computer (runs on windows and have realized that I need to dive into Linux as well). Then, I linked our Git Hub organization to the app installed on my device and opened our project within my branch to write this blog entry and finally make a pull request to get it published here on the blog.  
I kind of understand whats going on, but this is actually fucking nuts. I have a feeling I'm embarking on a very wild adventure. Upside, getting back to visual studio and writing code. Hopefully it will be the push to get me out of education and into programming!
